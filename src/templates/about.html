        <h2>What is DataExpress?</h2>
    </div>
    <p>DataExpress is a <a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> toolkit for writing Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) procedures. DataExpress includes a domain specific language (DSL) that covers common ETL operations such as copying the results of a SQL query from one relational database to another.</p>
    <div class="page-header">
        <h2>Motivation
            <small>Doesn't something like this exist already?</small>
        </h2>
    </div>
    <p>The world certainly does not suffer from a dearth of ETL tools. Most tools fall into one of two categories. On one end, there are traditional
    large-scale ETL frameworks (such as <a href="http://kettle.pentaho.com/">Pentaho Kettle</a> or <a href="http://www.informatica.com/us/">Informatica</a>) that 
    are designed for big, repeatable processes. On the other end of the spectrum, there are a number of tools like <a href="http://www.databrewery.org/">Data Brewery</a> that are more 
    lightweight. However, we found that neither kind of solution was a solid fit for many of the use cases we have had. Many Java-based ETL tools have 
    great cross-database support (thanks to <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/overview-141217.html">JDBC</a>), but require a big upfront time investment for simple ETL tasks. Tools built in Perl, Python, or Ruby
    can be more productive for simple tasks, but it is often hard to configure obscure database drivers and wrappers.</p>
    <p>The enterprise-class database support offered by the hundreds of available JDBC drivers on the Java Virtual Machine is hard to ignore. We sought the programming
        simplicity and expressiveness offered by languages like Python, Perl, or Ruby. But at the same time, we also wanted to avoid the 
    boilerplate, build tools, IDE's, and configuration files that are common in many Java projects. </p>

        <h2>Scala Implementation
            <small>Why didn't you pick INSERT_FAVORITE_LANGUAGE_HERE?</small>
        </h2>
    </div>
    <p>We chose Scala primarily because it offered a balance of features in line with our goals, namely:</p>
    <ul>
       <li><strong>JDBC Drivers and Other Libraries</strong>: Scala runs on the JVM and can use libraries developed originally for Java. This means
       DataExpress can easily use the hundreds of JDBC database drivers that are available as well as things like <a href="http://poi.apache.org/">Apache POI</a> for Excel file access.</li>
       <li><strong>Scripting Support</strong>: Scala offers the ability to write programs as scripts so that there's no need for an explicit compilation step. Scripts can be edited quickly with just a text editor.</li>
        <li><strong>Expressive Syntax with Type Inference</strong>: Scala offers a syntax with many features users of languages such as Python and Ruby have come to expect. While strongly-typed, much of Scala's type system remains behind the scenes most of the time thanks to solid type inference.</li>
        <li><strong>Support for Domain Specific Languages</strong>: One of the design goals of Scala is to support Domain Specific Languages (DSL's). We felt strongly that many common ETL functions could be rolled up into a convenient syntax, and this capability makes DataExpress more accessible to 
people who might otherwise not be as comfortable with some of Scala's more advanced features.</li>
       <li><strong>Performance</strong>: Scala has been designed from the ground-up for maximum performance. While we don't yet take advantage of
       the many parallelization features the language has to offer, we think this offers substantial future potential</li>
    </ul>
    <div class="page-header">
        <h2>Do I need to learn Scala?</h2>
    </div>
        <p>While any amount of Scala or Java knowledge will be to your benefit, especially when debugging your scripts, the amount of Scala you need to know will vary depending on what you want to accomplish. We have tried very hard to make the DSL for DataExpress work in a way that is familiar to someone who has some experience in Perl, Python, or Ruby but isn't necessarily a Java or Scala expert. That said, if you have very complex transformation logic that you need to code up, there's no getting around the need to write some Scala. DataExpress is meant to abstract away all the glue code you need to write in order to work with relational databases in the JVM. But it doesn't magically make complex programming logic easy. </p>
    <div class="page-header">
        <h2>Target Audience
        </h2>
    </div>
<p>We created DataExpress to fit usage scenarios we encounter all the time. It's important to realize that depending on your needs, it may not
be the best fit for what you want to do. In general, the more of the following that are true for you, the more likely you'll feel at home 
with DataExpress:</p>
       <ul>
            <li>Need to perform simple ETL tasks like copying the results of queries or whole tables</li>
            <li>Need to access a variety of relational database systems which may not have a driver available for your operating system</li>
            <li>Prefer high level languages like Python, Perl, or Ruby</li>
            <li>Need to write scripts that do not justify a large time investment</li>
       </ul>

        <h2>Getting Started
            <small>Sounds great, I'm in</small>
        </h2>
<p>The easiest way to get started is to go through our <a href="/quickstart/">Quick Start</a> guide which will tell you all you need to know to get up and running.</p>

<p><span class="label label-important">Important</span></p>

<p>DataExpress is still in very early stages of development. We consider this beta software and expect that many components, including the DSL and API may
change over time. That being said, we are getting a lot of use out of it in its current form and wanted to share it (warts and all) with a wider audience. <strong>Please
    be mindful of this status when considering its use in production</strong>.</p>
